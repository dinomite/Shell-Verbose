NAME
    Shell::Verbose - A verbose version of system()

SYNOPSIS
        # Nothing is exported by default
        use Shell::Verbose qw/verboseSystem vsys/;

        verboseSystem('echo "foo"');
        # echo "foo"
        # foo

        # Short form
        vsys('echo "foo"');
        # echo "foo"
        # foo

        # Returns a true value when the command is successful
        print "How did true fail!?\n" unless (vsys('true');

        Shell::Verbose->prefix('===> ');
        # ===> echo 'foo'
        # foo

        Shell::Verbose->before('Running the next line');
        # Running the next line
        # ===> echo 'foo'
        # foo

        Shell::Verbose->after('That was easy');
        # Running the next line
        # ===> echo 'foo'
        # foo
        # That was easy

DESCRIPTION
    A simple wrapper for system() that prints the command

METHODS
  verboseSystem($command)
    Run the specified command, printing the command along with before,
    prefix, and after if defined.

    Returns the inverse of shell success, that is a true value (1) if the
    command exited with zero status (success) and a false value (0) if the
    command exited with a non-zero status (failure). See $? ($CHILD_ERROR)
    for the real deets.
